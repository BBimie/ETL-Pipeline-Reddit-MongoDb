But as you probably know the API changes have had an impact in our ability to moderate efficiently. I won't bore you with the details, but in short moderating is less efficient using the official mod tools because of the number of clicks and unintuitive UI, even on the mod tools exempted from the API cost the respond time has been slowed down, and we lost some vital mod tools and helpful bots because the creators of those tools lost faith in Reddit and aren't going to put more effort into doing Reddit's job for them.\n\nOne of the tools we lost is [BotDefense](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/). A bot that worked across subreddits to ban malicious bots,  like the comment copying bots. This left us dealing with malicious bots running rampant, with hundreds of bots 'hatching' some days. Since Reddit's spam filter won't pick these bots up, and they killed our best defense against them, we have to try something new. Which leads me to the topic of this month's post:\n\n# Enter the Bot Hunters\n\nYou might notice some users with a shiny new \"Bot Hunter \\[#\\]\" flair. For months ([years?](https://media.giphy.com/media/v6taBvOBc5fn4KS2RV/giphy.gif)) when talking to mods from other subs or the admins, we've raved about our 'bot hunter army.\" Users that call out these bots and make it easier for us to identify and ban them. So, in order to combat the continued bot problem on Reddit we've made our bot hunter army official. By giving a user this flair we've empowered them to ban and purge these bots themselves.\n\nTo celebrate and recognize how much they help keep the sub clean of these pests, we have the tally of kills in the flair (a Bot Hunter \\[25\\] has banned 25 bots). We even have an internal 'scoreboard' tracking their kills!\n\n\nWe're starting out with a small group, but will continue to add users with a good history of bot spotting.\n\n# Happy bot hunting!\n\n___\n\n# Keep things civil.

Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don\u2019t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won\u2019t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all. They did get pictures but they were on cellphones.\n\nAITA?",

I was not part of the wedding, just a guest which I was fine with. Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don\u2019t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won\u2019t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all. They did get pictures but they were on cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Throwaway because family uses Reddit.\n\nI am unmarried and do not have children so I don't understand this situation from a parent's standpoint. I have a niece, Kay 21, and a nephew, Joe 16. My sister and her husband have spent the last few years (since the pandemic started) trying to get Kay sorted. By that I mean she has a lot of unexplained ailments. They've been seeing specialists, chiropractors, acupuncture, etc. To this day I'm still not entirely sure what is wrong. Kay posts on social media a lot about feeling fatigued, having migraines, weakness, and other symptoms along with her various appointments. Personally I worry this is being driven by attention because it has become her entire personality.\n\nI try to help Kay when I can (I've taken her to a few appointments because she doesn't drive) but I've tried to be present mostly for Joe who is overshadowed by all of this. Joe is a very simple young man and doesn't ask for much but I can tell he wants some attention. He makes this known by pushing himself in sports, getting the best grades, getting a job, and trying to be as independent as possible. He's 16 but acts 20. It kind of sucks to watch.\n\nFor his birthday I bought two tickets to a football game and transferred them to my sister so that she or her husband could take him. I told them that if they absolutely couldn't then I would but they accepted the tickets. Fast forward a couple weeks later and I see a post from my sister selling two football game tickets and they were very quickly bought. I confronted her and said those tickets were for Joe. Her response was they needed help covering new allergy testing for Kay and that's what the money would be used for.\n\nI took Joe to lunch yesterday and asked him how he is really doing. He was honest and said he doesn't feel like an equal member of his family and I told him I see it too. I asked him why he agreed to sell his birthday tickets and learned he never did and never even knew anything about them. I told him the sequence of events. He was quiet for a bit and then sighed and accepted it. To my surprise he must have said something to his parents because they called me for a conversation, accusing me of being an AH and saying I hurt Joe's feelings and that he was better off not knowing. I disagree wholeheartedly but am open to other perspectives. AITA?\n\nAnd yes I am trying to buy new tickets for Joe.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI'll try to respond to people as I can. I spoke with Joe individually today. I'm not surprised, but he said he confronted them because he wanted them to give me the money back. As usual the kid is thinking of others.\n\n  \nWhile I don't want to be accused of trying to turn him against his parents, I do want to follow his lead in regards to him potentially staying with me. That said, I am going to make more of an effort to spend more time with him.\n\n  \nAs far as Kay is concerned. I know her health issues are very real and I want more than nothing for her to feel well. However, she has been behaving manipulatively towards her parents, grandparents, myself, and Joe for a while now. Again, I worry that how she is dealing with her ailments is unhealthy for her and the family. We all support her and do what we can to support her and help her to be well.",

I was annoyed by this alone as it\u2019s a long drive and I wanted to get there before 2am. \n\nHour 1 of the journey (with Jane in the car), she requested to stop to use the restroom. So we stopped. \n\nHour 2 of the journey she requested my girlfriend turned the music COMPLETELY off as she \u2018didn\u2019t like music\u2019?? \n\nHour 3 of the journey Jane wanted to stop for some food, I asked her to hold on an hour as I had already planned where we were stopping and getting gas and I wanted to limit stops. Jane then spent the next hour complaining of \u2018feeling sick and faint\u2019. \n\nHour 4, we stopped and Jane disappeared for half an hour and when my girlfriend found her she was just sat outside on FaceTime one of her friends. \n\nHour 5, we stopped because Jane needed to use the restroom. At which point Jane purchased another meal. \n\nHour 6, I pulled over so Jane could sit shotgun as she was \u2018getting car sick\u2019. At which point she wanted to debate why marriage is archaic and exists to limit women. \n\nHour 7, stopped for restroom and more snacks at Janes requests. \n\nHour 8, we are on the final stretch to my Moms house and Jane requests to stop again. I say no, we are nearly there. Jane then says that she is going to be sick and we have to stop. I refuse, and say I will pull over if she\u2019s going to actually be sick but we are 30 minutes away. \n\nWhen we arrive at my moms house she announces to my step dad, that I refused to stop the car for her and she\u2019s so ill etc. My mom then shouts at me \u2018because I know Jane is sensitive\u2019. Jane is 29, I am 28 so not children. \n\nSince then all weekend Jane has made reference to it and told my girlfriend that I \u2018can be cruel and nasty and has been since a child\u2019. I have now said I am not driving her back, she now has no transport home. AITA?",

I\u2019ll UPDATE tomorrow) \n\nSo I (m25) am ready to settle, I own a bakery as side hustle, and my main job as an IT developer.\n\nMy partner (f26) and I have been together for 4 years. She works as a vet tech, she schedules our trips, and she is great at cooking! I\u2019m in charge of decorating and baking. All is well, or so I thought until her parents came by.\n\nNow her parents never liked me because I\u2019m not a guy from their race/culture. They think I\u2019m not serious, whatever reasons they could grab onto to hate me \n\nMy partner knows this and the most she can do is tell them to stop or change topics. It\u2019s not helping. When I try to tell them off or kick them out, she says it\u2019s her parents and I feel guilty\n\nJust yesterday her parents came by and spoke to her about something, told me to not invade their privacy. I shrugged it off and asked my partner later what they told her.\n\nShe said it\u2019s nothing, \u201cJust them being them\u201d.\nI directly told her I felt that she\u2019s lying to me, she got upset and waved me off, walking off.\n\nA day go by, she came home late. I text her sibling if she had been drinking with them or something, where she is etc. And they told me everything, spilled. \n\nShe basically was on a blind date with different guys because of parents request. And how she couldn\u2019t say no forever. I told her wtf and we are partners, I just remember being pissed off and insulting her parents. I told her she\u2019s being a pushover and it\u2019s ruining our relationship.\n\nShe yelled at me and told me to understand, she was emotional and voice cracks. Her culture tied her down, she said. I told her she can either stop being a pushover and get away from those blind dates or we are over. I went to sleep at my bakery, it sucked. I also feel guilty, there were better way to handle it but I couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nWoke up and over 100+ notifs from her and her family, blasting me.. my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her\n\nIdk what to do now. I\u2019m still pissed\n\nAnd AITA for just leaving?\n\nEDIT: info: She also told me she agreed just to get her parents to stop bothering us at our place and arguing with the security team, and how she didn\u2019t stay long at the blind dates, told her blind dates she wants nothing to do with them. And she sent screenshots of her telling her parents off, how she\u2019s done with them and she\u2019s serious about me.\nEDIT: I think people are confusing her blind dates. She had 3 blind dates in one day and no more after the first day. She didn\u2019t emotionally or physically cheat, she just was there and left shortly after. I don\u2019t believe she cheated.\n\nEDIT: Also my partner does deal with abusive parents, I didn\u2019t ask about her family that much because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable so don\u2019t come at me for not asking her family life. But then again come at me, I should have asked and been there for her but I wasn\u2019t. She struggled and pressured by parents while I overlooked the sentences she\u2019s said randomly and then being sarcastic, stuff like \u201cMaybe if I wasn\u2019t here, you would find someone better\u201d and then she\u2019d tell me she\u2019s kidding and laughing it off, I didn\u2019t think much of it. This is my third relationship and my longest. And yes her dad does beat her, or he did more during her childhood, I asked her and she didn\u2019t respond but only told me how sorry she is for doing the dates before letting me know.\n\nShe did tell me over text. Also the timeline, let me word it properly cause people are freaking out \ud83d\ude05:\n08/26\u2013 Parents came by and discussed, the part where they told me not to invade their privacy. Also when I say a day went by, I\u2019m transitioning to the day she was gone to meet up the arranged dates. Not saying she\u2019s been gone for a day. \n\n08/27\u2013  I did not see her in the morning as usual before going to work. So I asked her sibling where she went, if she\u2019s with them, because I needed her to run an errand while I open up the bakery. She took the car so, mine is at the mechanic being fixed. Her siblings told me she went to a date. Today she came back around afternoon and I confronted her, we argued and I left. I took a nap at the bakery, woke up some hours later to bunch of notifications. We plan to talk tomorrow.",

I\u2019ll UPDATE tomorrow) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I (m25) am ready to settle, I own a bakery as side hustle, and my main job as an IT developer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner (f26) and I have been together for 4 years. She works as a vet tech, she schedules our trips, and she is great at cooking! I\u2019m in charge of decorating and baking. All is well, or so I thought until her parents came by.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now her parents never liked me because I\u2019m not a guy from their race/culture. They think I\u2019m not serious, whatever reasons they could grab onto to hate me &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner knows this and the most she can do is tell them to stop or change topics. It\u2019s not helping. When I try to tell them off or kick them out, she says it\u2019s her parents and I feel guilty&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just yesterday her parents came by and spoke to her about something, told me to not invade their privacy. I shrugged it off and asked my partner later what they told her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said it\u2019s nothing, \u201cJust them being them\u201d.\nI directly told her I felt that she\u2019s lying to me, she got upset and waved me off, walking off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A day go by, she came home late. I text her sibling if she had been drinking with them or something, where she is etc. And they told me everything, spilled. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She basically was on a blind date with different guys because of parents request. And how she couldn\u2019t say no forever. I told her wtf and we are partners, I just remember being pissed off and insulting her parents. I told her she\u2019s being a pushover and it\u2019s ruining our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She yelled at me and told me to understand, she was emotional and voice cracks. Her culture tied her down, she said. I told her she can either stop being a pushover and get away from those blind dates or we are over. I went to sleep at my bakery, it sucked. I also feel guilty, there were better way to handle it but I couldn\u2019t help it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Woke up and over 100+ notifs from her and her family, blasting me.. my partner was apologizing and she will try to stop letting her family get to her&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idk what to do now. I\u2019m still pissed&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And AITA for just leaving?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: info: She also told me she agreed just to get her parents to stop bothering us at our place and arguing with the security team, and how she didn\u2019t stay long at the blind dates, told her blind dates she wants nothing to do with them. And she sent screenshots of her telling her parents off, how she\u2019s done with them and she\u2019s serious about me.\nEDIT: I think people are confusing her blind dates. She had 3 blind dates in one day and no more after the first day. She didn\u2019t emotionally or physically cheat, she just was there and left shortly after. I don\u2019t believe she cheated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Also my partner does deal with abusive parents, I didn\u2019t ask about her family that much because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable so don\u2019t come at me for not asking her family life. But then again come at me, I should have asked and been there for her but I wasn\u2019t. She struggled and pressured by parents while I overlooked the sentences she\u2019s said randomly and then being sarcastic, stuff like \u201cMaybe if I wasn\u2019t here, you would find someone better\u201d and then she\u2019d tell me she\u2019s kidding and laughing it off, I didn\u2019t think much of it. This is my third relationship and my longest. And yes her dad does beat her, or he did more during her childhood, I asked her and she didn\u2019t respond but only told me how sorry she is for doing the dates before letting me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She did tell me over text. Also the timeline, let me word it properly cause people are freaking out \ud83d\ude05:\n08/26\u2013 Parents came by and discussed, the part where they told me not to invade their privacy. Also when I say a day went by, I\u2019m transitioning to the day she was gone to meet up the arranged dates. Not saying she\u2019s been gone for a day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;08/27\u2013  I did not see her in the morning as usual before going to work. So I asked her sibling where she went, if she\u2019s with them, because I needed her to run an errand while I open up the bakery. She took the car so, mine is at the mechanic being fixed. Her siblings told me she went to a date. Today she came back around afternoon and I confronted her, we argued and I left. I took a nap at the bakery, woke up some hours later to bunch of notifications. We plan to talk tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He was a deadbeat dad to our dad and only sniffing around 5ish years ago. My sister wanted to know him but the rest of us were like no fucking way. So when my sister announced her son's name, it was a bit of a wtf moment for us. Dad didn't actually comment on the name. He just said his grandson was beautiful and he couldn't wait to spend more time with him and congratulated my sister. My sister asked him directly about the name and he ignored her.\n\nI told my sister she was pushing her luck expecting him to say something nice about the name. She said this is her grandson and everyone ignored his name, even though we all used the name, we just didn't comment about it.\n\nShe said she thought it could bring some healing to dad and his deadbeat father. I told her she's dumb to think that and even dumber to think he'd be glad she used the name. We ended up at a standoff and she was like that's no way to speak to a newly post partum mom. I told her she was looking for a fight and she should be glad dad held back and didn't comment because I'm sure she'd hate what he has to say.\n\nNow we're not really talking and she said I went after her too hard when she was recovering from the birth of her baby, something I'll never understand as a guy.\n\nAITA?",

My sister wanted to know him but the rest of us were like no fucking way. So when my sister announced her son&amp;#39;s name, it was a bit of a wtf moment for us. Dad didn&amp;#39;t actually comment on the name. He just said his grandson was beautiful and he couldn&amp;#39;t wait to spend more time with him and congratulated my sister. My sister asked him directly about the name and he ignored her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I told my sister she was pushing her luck expecting him to say something nice about the name. She said this is her grandson and everyone ignored his name, even though we all used the name, we just didn&amp;#39;t comment about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said she thought it could bring some healing to dad and his deadbeat father. I told her she&amp;#39;s dumb to think that and even dumber to think he&amp;#39;d be glad she used the name. We ended up at a standoff and she was like that&amp;#39;s no way to speak to a newly post partum mom.

He has a ten year old son from his previous marriage and I love him a lot, my husband splits custody with his ex-wife 50/50 with them alternating weeks. They have been in talks about my Stepsons education for a while as he doesn't thrive in a traditional schooling environment and they want to homeschool him. If done right I don't see an issue with this even though I do have concerns about his social needs. I expressed those thoughts but beyond that I didn't offer much input, he's their son and his education is up to them.\n\nI had an issue however when they seemed to think that I could oversee his education when he's staying with his father and I. They even commented how i'm always home so it's perfect, I work remotely as a Data Analyst so yes i'm around but i'm working and not free to play teacher. Helping with homework outside of work is fine but actually teaching? that's not my job. I told them as much and said if they want to do this either his mum will have to come round during my work hours or they'll have to hire a tutor as I won't be splitting my focus between teaching him and my job, I even told them i'd be happy to put money towards the tutor. \n\nThey feel i'm being unreasonable and his ex-wife even questioned if I see their son as my family if i've got so little interest in his schooling and what is best for him. This led to harsh words said on both sides, my husband actually took her side in this and has told me he's disappointed in me, that it's not like his son is a little kid who'll be underfoot constantly and surely the point of remote working is that I can have a balance to help out around the home, I suggested if he felt that way maybe he should see about working remotely. \n\nI feel pretty shit about this, I love my stepson and I want a good future for him and for an education he thrives in but I don't see why it's down to me to educate him when I work fulltime even if that work is from home. My husband is currently really upset with me and the fact they're both in agreement in this is making me question if i'm in the wrong and being an asshole.\n\nEdit: I'd like to be clear, they could in theory homeschool him properly this isn't something they're wanting to do with no experience. His ex-wife is a former teacher but had to leave her job due to her health.\n\nUPDATE: Hi everyone, sorry i've not been answering messages/very responsive on here. A few hours after this post went up my Husband and I got into a huge fight and I brought up this post and some of the answers which led to him being angry that i'd shared our business online. I ended up packing up my stuff and after a few texts I arranged to go stay with my brother and his husband. I've told my Husband he needs to sort his shit out and figure out an arrangement that doesn't involve me before I come home and even then I won't be back until he agrees to counselling together.",

Not sure what the point of it is but our teacher said it will become relevant in a few weeks. My stepmom and stepsister both assumed I would write about my dad and stepmom's relationship. It was brought up when my stepmom asked how come I hadn't asked her and dad any questions about their relationship yet. I was confused why she was asking that and wasn't putting two and two together right then and she said I should at least ask some questions before doing my paper. This is when it clicked with me and I told her my paper wasn't on them. My stepsister was in the room at the time and asked me why. I asked why I'd write a paper about their marriage instead of my parents marriage. My stepmom said because her and my dad's marriage was the forever one and seeing as my mom is dead and my dad isn't good at talking about stuff it makes more sense to write about them. She said she and my dad would be more inspiring for me anyway. \n\nI asked her if she ever thought I tried not to think about their relationship too hard since she and my dad had a very long history and that as soon as my mom died he ran back to her and married her. Did she ever think that wasn't something I loved but something I struggled with as the son he had with his first wife.\n\nThey were all about \"we're a family, it's okay to admit this is better\" and that kind of thing. I told them I was writing about my grandparents and to leave it alone. They pushed the issue and said it made more sense to \"write about your parents\" and I said it has already been pointed out that I can't since my mom is dead and dad is useless at that stuff. Stepmom said her, that she's my parent. I ignored that and went on about my day.\n\nBut they brought it up again a couple of days after that and said I should want to write about dad and stepmom and I was being weird about it because they will be the primary relationship to model myself after. \n\nI snapped. I told them they were idiots if they thought my most inspiring relationship is one that showed how little my dad cared about my mom, something he said mom would have felt if she knew he went back to the ex he never got over. I told them they are full of themselves to think they mean that much to me that I would shit on my mom. I also told them they were deluded. Deluded to think the woman who showed up at my mom's funeral to get my dad back would be the person I would find inspiring in any way.\n\nThey're angry that I said what I did to them and I might be a jerk for it.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso my stepsister is like 19 or 20. My dad and stepmom got married when I was 9, 8ish months after my mom died.",

The main issue with my fiance and me attending is mainly money based. We make a pretty good living combined but we are saving for our own wedding, a house and a second car as well as trying to plan for a family in the next 3ish years. \n\nFor a quick breakdown it would cost us a little over 2k to stay at the resort for three nights in the cheapest room with the block discount.\n\nIt will cost around 3k for airfare for the two of us.\n\nWe have animals at home that will need to be cared for and that will come out to about 1k.\n\nAll of these costs are about half of what we are planning on spending on our wedding next year.\n\nMy brother has put me specifically on a \"need to attend\" list and has stated that \"If people want to be there for our wedding they will find a way\".\n\nWe could make the trip work monetarily but it's going to wipe out a lot of progress we've made with saving and paying down debts like student loans which we have in excess of 40k each. We could even push our wedding off until 2025 but we want to be married sooner than later. I could go by myself leaving my fiance by his lonesome to handle the animals but this doesn't seem fair to him as we rarely take vacations.\n\nAlso, as a note, my brother and his wife are already legally married and had a celebration with select family in the states last year that we couldn't make it to. The reasons here is they invited us out to California (we live on the east coast) when other family was going to be in town but did not tell us they were going to be getting married. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I didn't attend the destination wedding?\n\nUpdate-\n\nIn talking with my fiance, family and brother we decided we will not be attending the wedding. Instead, we will be sending them a small monetary gift (about as much as tickets cost to get them to our wedding) and provide the honeymoon sweet room to my brother and his wife at our wedding. \n\nNo one was too upset with the exception of his wife, who just wanted us there for her day. Everyone understands and gets why we are prioritizing what we are.",

The resort they are having the wedding at is an all inclusive in the Caribbean. The main issue with my fiance and me attending is mainly money based. We make a pretty good living combined but we are saving for our own wedding, a house and a second car as well as trying to plan for a family in the next 3ish years. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a quick breakdown it would cost us a little over 2k to stay at the resort for three nights in the cheapest room with the block discount.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will cost around 3k for airfare for the two of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have animals at home that will need to be cared for and that will come out to about 1k.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of these costs are about half of what we are planning on spending on our wedding next year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother has put me specifically on a &amp;quot;need to attend&amp;quot; list and has stated that &amp;quot;If people want to be there for our wedding they will find a way&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We could make the trip work monetarily but it&amp;#39;s going to wipe out a lot of progress we&amp;#39;ve made with saving and paying down debts like student loans which we have in excess of 40k each. We could even push our wedding off until 2025 but we want to be married sooner than later. I could go by myself leaving my fiance by his lonesome to handle the animals but this doesn&amp;#39;t seem fair to him as we rarely take vacations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, as a note, my brother and his wife are already legally married and had a celebration with select family in the states last year that we couldn&amp;#39;t make it to. The reasons here is they invited us out to California (we live on the east coast) when other family was going to be in town but did not tell us they were going to be getting married. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would I be the asshole if I didn&amp;#39;t attend the destination wedding?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In talking with my fiance, family and brother we decided we will not be attending the wedding. Instead, we will be sending them a small monetary gift (about as much as tickets cost to get them to our wedding) and provide the honeymoon sweet room to my brother and his wife at our wedding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one was too upset with the exception of his wife, who just wanted us there for her day. Everyone understands and gets why we are prioritizing what we are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

As a birthday gift my brother and his partner wanted to fly the girls to Alpine, WY, for hiking and to play in the river. They own their own small plane, my brother\u2019s husband was a marine pilot and flying is now his hobby. The trip is a little less than an hour by plane, so this would be a day trip for them.\n\nThe problem is I just don\u2019t trust this plane... it\u2019s so small, only 5 people fit in it and that includes the pilot. That means either myself or my husband could go and my husband has been trying to persuade me since he LOVES planes and he\u2019s telling me how safe it is. I think he just wants to go as a treat to himself, and he told me I just don\u2019t want to let them go because I\u2019m controlling. We got into an argument over it and he\u2019s very upset that I won\u2019t even consider it. Does that make me an asshole, to be worried about this?\n\nEdit to add the girls have no idea this was offered. My brother and BIL brought the idea up with me and my husband and I immediately told them *absolutely* not. I honestly do not care how much training he has, there's not enough training where I'd trust to let my girls get off the ground in that plane. Besides, the girls have asked to go up before and I've always said no, so I don't know why my BIL would think now would be different? At least though they didn't go behind my back and promise this to the girls first.",

As a birthday gift my brother and his partner wanted to fly the girls to Alpine, WY, for hiking and to play in the river. They own their own small plane, my brother\u2019s husband was a marine pilot and flying is now his hobby. The trip is a little less than an hour by plane, so this would be a day trip for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is I just don\u2019t trust this plane... it\u2019s so small, only 5 people fit in it and that includes the pilot. That means either myself or my husband could go and my husband has been trying to persuade me since he LOVES planes and he\u2019s telling me how safe it is. I think he just wants to go as a treat to himself, and he told me I just don\u2019t want to let them go because I\u2019m controlling. We got into an argument over it and he\u2019s very upset that I won\u2019t even consider it. Does that make me an asshole, to be worried about this?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit to add the girls have no idea this was offered. My brother and BIL brought the idea up with me and my husband and I immediately told them &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; not. I honestly do not care how much training he has, there&amp;#39;s not enough training where I&amp;#39;d trust to let my girls get off the ground in that plane. Besides, the girls have asked to go up before and I&amp;#39;ve always said no, so I don&amp;#39;t know why my BIL would think now would be different? At least though they didn&amp;#39;t go behind my back and promise this to the girls first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It was known to everyone and she never had a problem sharing with people and giving them tips on who to go to, the aftermath and everything.   \nWe are now 30 and the whole friend group knows and whenever she meets new people she tells them (or so she told me). Yesterday she invited me to her and her husband\u2019s and we were playing some old video tapes and pictures of our memories and we were reminiscing the past and everything. Until a photo of her pre surgery appeared and her husband was like \u201coh she look so different\u201d so I was like \u201coh it must\u2019ve been pre surgery\u201d. He was like \u201cwhat surgery?\u201d I looked at him then at her then she tried to deflect the situation but the setting was awkward for the rest of the night.  \nApparently she dated him and married him but she lied about getting work done and he believed her. After I left he Ig demanded answers which forced her to say the truth. She called me today saying I am the AH for exposing her but I was like \u201chow could\u2019ve known you lied to him when you are always upfront about it\u201d like if she doesn\u2019t mention it herself she expects me to mention it on her behalf to other people we meet\u2026except her husband.

Yesterday she invited me to her and her husband\u2019s and we were playing some old video tapes and pictures of our memories and we were reminiscing the past and everything. Until a photo of her pre surgery appeared and her husband was like \u201coh she look so different\u201d so I was like \u201coh it must\u2019ve been pre surgery\u201d. He was like \u201cwhat surgery?\u201d I looked at him then at her then she tried to deflect the situation but the setting was awkward for the rest of the night.&lt;br/&gt;\nApparently she dated him and married him but she lied about getting work done and he believed her. After I left he Ig demanded answers which forced her to say the truth. She called me today saying I am the AH for exposing her but I was like \u201chow could\u2019ve known you lied to him when you are always upfront about it\u201d like if she doesn\u2019t mention it herself she expects me to mention it on her behalf to other people we meet\u2026except her husband. I also told her she invited me to view our old photos why didn\u2019t she just give me heads up about it like she knew old photos pre surgery would appear.&lt;br/&gt;\nShe hung up on me saying she doesn\u2019t wanna know me anymore and that I am terrible secret keeper.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Her son was obviously in a lot of pain, and my friend very quickly bundled him up and took him to the hospital, but she has since texted me saying that I am responsible for any and all medical costs as I chose to have dangerous items in the house and did not properly childproof.\n\nI am obviously quite sorry that this happened, but I told her that she was the one who knocked the bunny off the shelf, and I couldn't have childproofed against an adult dropping something. I said that I feel terrible about all of this, but this is not my fault at the end of the day.\n\nMy husband agrees with me, but my friend's husband (M29) has texted me saying that I am \\[a very unkind word\\] for hurting their son and choosing not to take responsibility. He also threatened to call the police, but I told him that I was no where near the bunnies or their son, so I did not do anything wrong. He said my inability to childproof my home is reckless endangerment and they cannot afford the medical bills.\n\nI am so topsy turvy right now, and I feel like the AH for allowing my friend's son to be hurt like this, but I don't know if I am even the right person to blame. Was I the AH for not childproofing my nursery and by extension, hurting a child?\n\nAs an aside, the bookends have been returned. I don't want anything else to go wrong.",

Ive had Top Surgery, Ive been on Testosterone for almost 7 years now and I fully pass as a male. So Im a nanny, I sadly had a really hard time in school when I was younger due to my mental health and couldn't keep up with my schoolwork causing me to not be able to get into college.  So I decided instead of going to community college I would use the money I saved for college from working to fully medically transition. It was great, I had finally felt good in my body and was truly happy for the first time. Money was scarce and I love kids so I decided to start babysitting. One of my First jobs Was a nice single mom, we'll call her Lily. Her husband had died pretty early on in the pregnancy so she's been alone from the start. Her kid- Lets call him Ryan is a a pretty hyper kid. And Before you say \"Isn't every kid a little hyper?\" no. I mean this kid is ***hyper*** like he is bounce off the walls hyper. So when she came home one night from a long night at work to a peaceful sleeping child she was overjoyed, and she has continuously told me that is one of the main reasons she hired me. I quickly became Ryan's full time nanny. Teaching His mom How to make things like brushing his teeth or eating fun for him. She always praises me and tells me what good of a man I am and how she is so impressed on how feminine and motherly I am to children. Which yes, kinda rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nMy mother every once and awhile comes and visits, and this past weekend she was in town so she decided to come visit. We were walking around the local farmers market catching up when we ran into Ryan and his mom. I have weekends off but it is always nice to see Ryan outside of when i'm babysitting him so I went and said hi and introduced the two to my mom. Lily and my mom hit it off immediately and my mom asked that they become facebook friends. Now I don't have facebook  so Ive never actually seen my moms posts. So It was my surprise when Lily sent me a Facebook post about my transition- made by my mom. Lily went off on me, She started cursing me out, calling me slurs of all kind, and telling me I should be ashamed of myself. She told me that The only reason she hired me was because I was a Man and she wanted for Ryan to have a father figure in his life. She continued to lecture me about \"how ill always be a woman.\" and how she cant believe she let a monster touch her child. I am shattered. I cant believe that this woman that I trusted and that was becoming one of my closest friends was a transphobic monster. I have been cut out from her and Ryans life completely and she has blocked me on everything.\n\nI admit I know it was wrong to not tell her that I was trans but I consider that something very private due to it being something that I can get harmed for. I know it is not my fault for what Lily believes but I still feel guilty about letting Ryan live with that woman. AITA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was honored, I haven\u2019t seen him in a while because I live across the country.  \n\n\nWhen I arrived to his city, I was \u2018assigned\u2019 a bridesmaid call her Kelly. Now Kelly is a lovely woman however, I think we were only assigned each other because we are both black. Liz starts telling me that we are both single and perfect for each other, but there was nothing to indicate that at all besides us both being black. I should add as well that Liz had a lot more bridesmaids than Tom had as groomsmen.  \n\n\nThe first night the entire wedding party went out and it became clear that Kelly wanted to hook up. I was not into her at all so I kindly turned her down. She then starts interrogating me as to why, I try to give a generic answer but she starts listing off all of the reason why we are so perfect together.  I end up saying that I don\u2019t do the whole short term type thing and as we both live in completely different states there is no future here. She ends up cooling off but then tells me that she respects me more for that and that I am a stand up guy, and the type of guy that she is looking for.\n\n  \nDuring the rest of the time we are there, one of the other \u2018unmatched\u2019 bridesmaids (call her Jen) starts messaging me privately and we hit it off. The next day wedding ceremony goes well, we have the reception and me and Kelly do our entrance together and then dance together for a bit. After a bit, I go to the bar and Jen and I start to dance. At this point Kelly is giving me dirty looks. I just ignore it and continue having a good time.  \n\n\nAll is going well until when I am at the bar, Kelly and the Liz confront me and starts saying that me dancing with Jen is inappropriate. They start saying she is too young for me that it looks creepy. (FWIW I am 32 and she is 24 about to turn 25). I am like oh it\u2019s okay me and Jen are just friends. Liz at this point is angry with me and starts saying that Jen is in college (She is doing her Masters) and that this is her wedding and she doesn\u2019t want to see that. Then Kelly starts saying that I must have a fetish for White women. At this point I realize that there is no logical argument I can make.\n\n  \nI tell Kelly and Liz that I really enjoyed the wedding but I need to go to bed early for my flight the next day. I leave and go up to my hotel. 15 minutes later Jen leaves early.  5 minutes after Jen came up, we both get kicked out of the wedding party chat.\n\n  \nI later find out from Tom that Kelly was crying her eyes out. And that it messed up the night for Liz as well. He told me that he isn\u2019t mad at me because he told Liz from the start that Kelly isn\u2019t going to be my type, but instead Liz really wanted to set Kelly up. At this point I feel terrible that I made it so Liz was not able to enjoy her special night, as for Kelly I just wish she got no means no.",

People were commenting and he was responding. So I spilled all the sordid info on my family and I told him he runs the risk of his kid thinking of him as a piece of shit, of him having kids with both women and creating a mess where a family is never truly formed and since others were already saying it that he would destroy his wife and break his family before his child is even out in the world. He was really interested in my answer and asked a bunch of questions which I answered. I was fully honest and held nothing back.\n\nApparently someone in my dad's family was in the group and saw the post and my comments. They shared with my dad and his mistress and they went off on me. My dad said that is the kind of thing you don't share with the internet while his mistress asked if I enjoyed publicly shaming them.

He asked if all the years they have stayed together meant nothing to me and I said yeah, it doesn't change what he did, it doesn't take away the fact he made me come into the world in one of the messiest ways and he complains about the stuff he missed out on with me but he made choices and those had consequences.\n\nThey said no matter how I felt I never should have shared such personal information online.\n\nAITA?",

His girlfriend has had an issue with it from the start but recently things have escalated to the point where my daughter has been telling me she doesn\u2019t want to go stay with her dad because she feels like she\u2019s always in trouble because his girlfriend gets mad whenever he or his family do something nice for my kids that they don\u2019t do for hers. \n\nI\u2019ve spoken to my ex twice about this already but nothing has changed despite him promising he would speak to his girlfriend and reassure our daughter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for my kids to be somewhere they feel unwanted so I suggested my ex goes back to only having visitations with them for now but he completely blew up at me and wouldn\u2019t discuss it like a rational adult. He\u2019s been slandering me to his and my family and I\u2019m getting tired of having to explain that I\u2019m not trying to keep our kids away from him.\n\nAITA?",
